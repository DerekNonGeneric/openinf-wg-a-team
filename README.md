### On the Nature of Our Team’s Work

<br />

<section id="termdef-productivity"><strong><em>
  <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line line-length -->
  <dfn data-dfn-type="termdef" id="def-for-termdef-productivity" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0">productivity <a role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0" href="./#termdef-productivity" id="ref-for-termdef-productivity">⚓</a></dfn></em></strong>
is a fundamental metric quantifying the efficiency of a process. It is defined
as the ratio between the aggregate output generated and the total input resources
utilized, commonly represented mathematically as:</section>

<div align="center"><br /><br />

<figure id="productivity-ratio-equation">

```math
$$
\text{Productivity} \equiv \text{Output} : \text{Input}
$$
```

<figcaption>
  <em><strong>Fig. 1</strong> Equation expressing the
    <a href="./#termdef-productivity" id="ref-for-termdef-productivity③"
      >productivity</a
    > ratio as the output divided by the input, denoted using colon
    notation.</em>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<br /><br /></div>

After baseline productivity is characterized, temporal analysis and comparison
of this measure enables inference regarding productivity gains, losses, or
stagnation. Information systems thus facilitate longitudinal tracking of
productivity, providing insight into the impact of interventions and exogenous
factors on operational efficiency.

Maximizing productivity is an essential goal across industries and disciplines.
Elucidating the determinants of productivity through rigorous measurement and
evidence-based investigation is critical for informing managerial strategy and
resource allocation. The study of productivity therefore constitutes a vital
research area with implications for technological progress, economic growth, and
organizational success.

<br /><br />

<div align="center"><figure>

```math
$$
\text{Productivity (in percent)} \equiv \frac{\text{Output}}{\text{Input}} \times 100
$$
```

<figcaption>
  <em><strong>Fig. 2</strong> Equation expressing the
    <a href="./#termdef-productivity" id="ref-for-termdef-productivity③"
      >productivity</a
    > ratio (in percent) as the output divided by the input (in fractional form),
  multiplied by 100.</em>

As of 2023-02-14, _the Engineering Productivity group, a.k.a. the A-Team_, is no
longer a discrete team. Its operations are split between the new Product
Integrity WG meta-team and Engineering Operations. For now, many discussions
around the test and automation work that was formerly under Engineering
Productivity may [continue in our Matrix channel][].

<section id="ahoy">

### Ahoy!

<br />

Welcome to the homepage of the Engineering Productivity
<abbr title="Working Group">WG</abbr> (called “the A-Team” for nostalgic
reasons). Although previously formally known as the Automation and Tools team,
we often still use the nickname “A-Team”, and you’ll see A-Team references
scattered throughout our codebases. Although we are proud to now finally be
recognized as an officially chartered WG (Working Group), we still prefer the
“A-Team” nickname from our humble beginnings. Please preserve all instances of
this esoteric usage you may find while spelunking in our codebases by leaving
them as-is and untouched.

We’re a group of programmers who develop and support a wide range of services,
tools, and automation that serve the engineering teams at OpenINF, with a
specific focus on work that increases the productivity of those teams.

We are part of the [Release & Productivity meta-team][wg-release-n-productiv-meta].

<section id="our-mission">

### Our Mission

<br />

The Engineering Productivity WG is a diverse group of engineers passionate about
improving engineering quality and productivity at OpenINF. We are experts in
various coding languages and tools and are always looking for new ways to make
engineering more efficient and effective. We work with others in a responsive
and agile manner, striving to be a model of open development. We create,
maintain, and extend a diverse array of sustainable tools and systems that
derive and deliver information on the quality of OpenINF’s products and enhance
the impact and effectiveness of the OpenINF community.

### Connecting with the A-Team

<br />

We’re a friendly bunch of people happy to help you; we want to hear about your
ideas and problems. Please let us know what you think we can do to help you work
more productively.

### What We Work On

<br />

We work on various things that will vary from quarter to quarter, but the lists
below represent the general scope of our activities.

<br /><br />

#### Services

<br />

- Autoland
- Treeherder/Perfherder
- TestInformant

<br /><br />

#### Automation

<br />

- [web-platform-tests][]
- CI integration ([openinfbot][]/[Taskcluster][]),
- JS specification ([TC39 AssertionError
  Proposal][tc39-proposal-assertion-error])
- new test harnesses as needed

<br /><br />

#### Tools

<br />

- [mach][]
- GitHub Actions
- code coverage

</section> <!-- END #what-we-work-on -->

<br /><br />

<section id="what-we-do-not-work-on">

### What We Do Not Work On

<br />

We don’t own [asbuild][], [Taskcluster][], or [depot_tools][] (those belong to
our Release Engineering team, the Mozilla Taskcluster team, and a few select
owners in the Chromium project, respectively). However, we occasionally help
with those projects as well.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mqxx/GitHub-Markdown/main/blockquotes/badge/light-theme/tip.svg">
  <img alt="Tip" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mqxx/GitHub-Markdown/main/blockquotes/badge/dark-theme/tip.svg">
</picture><br>
    
We don’t write unit tests run in the test harnesses we own;
developers are best suited for &mdash; and responsible &mdash; for that.

We generally don’t write functional tests run in the harnesses we own. However,
we may help here occasionally, mainly when this is done in conjunction with
developing a new harness. Our interests here are empowering developers to write
tests independently, but we sometimes contribute tests here as part of the
bootstrapping process. As with unit tests, developers are best suited to writing
functional tests as they understand overall test coverage and design.

<br /><br />

<section id="meetings">

### Meetings

<br />

Every other Tuesday, we have a fortnightly meeting that lets out before noon U.S.
Pacific Time. We typically discuss status, and new projects, have demonstrations
of the latest tools & features, and sometimes even engage in bikeshedding.

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenINF/GitHub-Markdown/HEAD/blockquotes/badge/light-theme/info.svg">
  <img alt="Info" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenINF/GitHub-Markdown/HEAD/blockquotes/badge/dark-theme/info.svg">
</picture><br />

These regularly scheduled A-Team team meetings are not networking events;
however, we will occasionally host invited experts from the community to
make presentations relevant to our objectives and likely relevant to other
community members as well.

All are welcome; please join us!

### Goals and Projects

<br />

We set and deliver quarterly goals, which is usually an excellent place to see
what we’re up to. If you’d like us to incorporate some work into our plans, fill
out our project request form.

See the [Project Central wiki page][] for a list of projects we own.

### Getting Involved

<br />

We love contributors! We see community members as one of the keys to our success
and actively encourage their contributions. Working on the tooling, automation,
testing, and build systems at OpenINF is a fantastic introduction to OpenINF
development. There are two great ways to help: joining an existing project or
taking on one of our _starter_ projects to help rev up to speed.
